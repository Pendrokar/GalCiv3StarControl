## Star Control 2 scenario

Ur-Quan Kzer-Za and Ur-Quan Kohr-Ah are at permanent war with each other, termed the second Doctrinal Conflict. While the last war was won by the Kzer-Za using the Sa-Matra battle platform, in this war the Kzer-Za avoid using it or even its Battle Thralls. Most likely outcome is victory by the Kohr-Ah, though neither outcome is desireable to other races.

Sa-Matra is owned by Ur-Quan Kzer-Za and is unable to move until Ur-Quan Kohr-Ah are defeated.

Both Ur-Quan subraces would not attend United Planet conventions.

Events:

* When Ur-Quan Kzer-Za are defeated or end the Doctrinal Conflict. Kohr-Ah declare permanent war with all non-Ur-Quan races.
* When Ur-Quan Kohr-Ah are defeated. Sa-Matra is free to move. Ur-Quan Kzer-Za and all remaining Battle Thralls declare war on independent races. Once all of them are defeated, Kzer-Za demands surrender of each Battle Thrall, refusal makes that Battle Thrall go to war with Ur-Quan and its remaining Battle Thralls.
* When foreign ships enter Kohr-Ah space, then Kohr-Ah will declare war on that faction and remain so until all foreign ships within its territory are destroyed.
* Utwig and Supox offer the player to launch an invasion on Ur-Quan Kohr-Ah.
* Chmmr(Pre-Chmmr) may research/acquire a tech with which to remove Ur-Quan slaveshield around their homeworld and another technology to remove slaveshields on other planets.
* Spathi may research/acquire a tech with which to create a Ur-Quan slaveshield around their homeworld.
