## Star Control 2 scenario

Ur-Quan Kzer-Za and Ur-Quan Kohr-Ah are at permanent war with each other, termed the second Doctrinal Conflict. While the last war was won by the Kzer-Za using the Sa-Matra battle platform, in this war the Kzer-Za avoid using it or even its Battle Thralls. Most likely outcome is victory by the Kohr-Ah, though neither outcome is desireable to other races.

Sa-Matra is owned by Ur-Quan Kzer-Za and is unable to move until Ur-Quan Kohr-Ah are defeated.

Both Ur-Quan subraces would not attend United Planet conventions.

Events:

* When Ur-Quan Kzer-Za are defeated or end the Doctrinal Conflict. Kohr-Ah declare permanent war with all non-Ur-Quan races.
* When Ur-Quan Kohr-Ah are defeated. Sa-Matra is free to move. Ur-Quan Kzer-Za and all remaining Battle Thralls declare war on independent races. Once all of them are defeated, Kzer-Za demands surrender of each Battle Thrall, refusal makes that Battle Thrall go to war with Ur-Quan and its remaining Battle Thralls.
* When foreign ships enter Kohr-Ah space, then Kohr-Ah will declare war on that faction and remain so until all foreign ships within its territory are destroyed.
* Utwig and Supox offer the player to launch an invasion on Ur-Quan Kohr-Ah.
* Chmmr(Pre-Chmmr) may research/acquire a tech with which to remove Ur-Quan slaveshield around their homeworld and another technology to remove slaveshields on other planets.
* Spathi may research/acquire a tech with which to create a Ur-Quan slaveshield around their homeworld.

### Races:

Star Control 1/2 races listed at Ultronomicon(Star Control Wikia):

http://wiki.uqm.stack.nl/Main_Page

Ur-Quan Kohr-Ah:
* Technology almost equal to Ur-Quan Kzer-Za, except in weapon technology.
* At war with Ur-Quan Kzer-Za at the start of the game.
* Offensive weapons consists mostly of mass drivers(blades), laser weapons(immolation) are secondary without any missile weapons.
* While the Kohr-Ah are said to be powerful soldiers, they are not in it for the goods, they want to utterly annihilate their foes. Their invasion tactics destroy most of the infrastructure.
* The only two cases the Kohr-Ah would make contact with a non-Ur-Quan race is to either explain their Doctrine or offer the other race to commit suicide, which has never happened with the 5000+ races they claim to have annihilated.
* At war with other races if not at war with Ur-Quan Kzer-Za until the other races are annihilated.
* Left the United Planets

Ur-Quan Kzer-Za:
* Technology almost equal to Ur-Quan Kohr-Ah, except in weapon technology.
* At war with Ur-Quan Kzer-Za at the start of the game.
* Offensive weapons consists mostly of laser weapons(plasma), missile weapons are secondary(fighters).
* Puts other races behind a Slave shield, if they refuse to become Battle Thralls.
* Kzer-Za do not have slave buildings. While they do not by themselves own slaves, they demand Battle Thralls to man Ur-Quan Dreadnought's crew with one Ur-Quan captain. Since the Slave War is put on hold, the former has no notability for this mod.
* Has 7 Battle Thralls, who have to go to war, if demanded by Kzer-Za.
* Left the United Planets
