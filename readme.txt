XML file suffix convention: _StarControl
Better not to use SC, as someone might like to merge the mod with something with the same abbrevation, like say Starcraft(SC).

Add letters before "xml" in order to have the game ignore them.

All references to Earthlings are replaced with Humans, except in conversations.
