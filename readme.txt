Tabs or Spaces: Use Tabs so that each can set their own space width.

XML file suffix convention: _StarControl
Better not to use SC, as someone might like to merge the mod with something with the same abbrevation, like say Starcraft(SC).

Add letter 'i' before "xml" in order to have the game ignore them.

All references to 'Earthlings' are replaced with 'Humans', except in conversations.
